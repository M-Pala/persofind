      <p>The web is a great place, but a few dubious practices can ruin that perception. Of course, you can be conned anywhere, but the web allows perpetrators to reach thousands of people with little cost or effort. And when big multi-billion businesses use dark patterns recklessly, it’s downright shameful!</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Sites use dark patterns because they work. But it’s short-term thinking. Visitors always become wise to nefarious techniques and may never return.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Do the right thing, build trust in your brand, and you’ll retain customers without having to resort to dark patterns.</p>
